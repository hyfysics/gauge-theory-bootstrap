# Historical Code Snapshot — arXiv:2403.10772

This folder contains the **original version** of the *Gauge Theory Bootstrap (GTB)* code that was submitted as ancillary files with the following paper:

> **Title:** [Gauge Theory Bootstrap: Pion amplitudes and low energy parameters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10772)  
> **Authors:** Yifei He, Martin Kruczenski  
> **arXiv ID:** 2403.10772  
> **Date:** March 2024

## 📚 Background

The *Gauge Theory Bootstrap* framework was first introduced in:

> **Title:** [Bootstrapping Gauge Theories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12402)
> **Authors:** Yifei He, Martin Kruczenski
> **arXiv ID:** 2309.12402  
> **Date:** September 2023

However, no code was released with this paper. The version provided here was the first publicly available implementation, and was used to generate the results reported in arXiv:2403.10772.

## 📂 Contents

- `GTB_Mathematica.nb` — Mathematica notebook submitted with the arXiv ancillary files
- `GTB_MATLAB.m` — MATLAB notebook submitted with the arXiv ancillary files

These files are preserved here as a **historical record** for reproducibility and archival purposes.

## ⚠️ Status

This version of the code is **no longer actively maintained**. An updated implementation, used in:

> **Title:** [The Gauge Theory Bootstrap: Predicting pion dynamics from QCD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19332)
> **Authors:** Yifei He, Martin Kruczenski
> **arXiv ID:** 2505.19332  
> **Date:** May 2025

will be uploaded in a future commit under a separate folder. Ongoing development and improvements will be based on that newer version.
